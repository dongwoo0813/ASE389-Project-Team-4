# ASE389-Project-Team-4

Game files used to validate EEG classifier are contained in this repository.
Game file 1 is made in collaboration of Edward Jung, Heeyong Huh, and Andrew Repetski.

Game file 2 is made by Edward Jung and Andrew Repetski.

Both game files are made by Gamepy module in Python.

Although it is a simple moving game, it has been a good exercise to practice Python.

If I put more settings into game 2, I would be able to make pacman.

Fun stuff. Fun stuff.
